Telecommunication Customer Churn Prediction Analysis

Overview:
Built a machine learning model to predict customer churn across all U.S. states using data from ContractData.xls and CallsData.xls.

Process:

Data Preparation: Imported, cleaned, and encoded customer data (churn status, contract details, usage patterns).

Feature Selection: Used key variables such as account length, service plans, call usage, and customer service interactions.

Model Training: Trained a Decision Tree classifier to identify churn patterns.

Model Evaluation: Tested and scored model performance using standard metrics.

Outcome:
Delivered a predictive model capable of identifying at-risk customers, helping businesses improve retention, reduce revenue loss, and enable data-driven decisions.
